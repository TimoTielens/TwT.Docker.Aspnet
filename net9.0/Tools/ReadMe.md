# Tools
This folder holds all the tools/scripts that can be used to add to the container. Those scripts can be used to add perform logic in the container itself. 
There seems to be some funny stuff going on when the tools are touched by Windows. In this case it needs to be added via https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_bash_shell and the saved file needs to be handled.

It's recommended to remove this folder on the last step of the build!
